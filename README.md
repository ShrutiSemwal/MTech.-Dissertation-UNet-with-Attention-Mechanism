# MTech.-Dissertation-UNet-with-Attention-Mechanism

### This is the Mtech Dissertation work titled "Optimizing Green Building Implementation via Deep Learning Powered-Segmentation Techniques" contributed to the integration of green building domain and deep learning domain for sustainable development using AI.

#### Objectives:
Three objectives were defined for this thesis based on gaps identified with the help of comprehensive literature review.
        1. *Create a robust UNet-based deep learning model accurate for building segmentation.*\
        2. *Enhance the dataset using some advanced pre-processing techniques like **binary mask splitting**, **data augmentation** and then further improve it by creating a new dataset using **canny edge detection algorithm**.*\
        3. *Implement Labelling section for the model to highlight 5 most relevant building components that are aligned with green building standards or integrating vegetation.*
#### Dataset:
The dataset that has been used for this thesis is [CMP FACADE DATASET](Tylecek R. The cmp facade database. Czech Tech. Univ., Prague, Czechia, Res. Rep. CTU–CMP–2012–24. 2012.).
#### Model:
Model has been defined using **UNet structure incorporating Spatial Multiplicative Cross Attention Mechanism**. Total 9 fits were implementated for model training. It was evaluated using Accuracy, Mean Intersection over Union, Precision, Recall and F1-Score. Predictions have been depicted in plots.
